Q1：
It requires to create a C++ program in a separate source file named pi_approx.cpp. 
That should include a function called pi_approx that approximates the value of π using given formulas (1) and (2), 
take the number of intervals N as an input. 
The program should return a struct called PiResults containing the computed value of π and the corresponding absolute error.

Q2:
It should  create a C++ function named approximations that takes a vector of positive integers as input. 
For each integer ni in the input vector, 
the function should compute an approximation of π using a predefined formula  and ni intervals. 
The computed approximations should be stored in a dynamically allocated C-style array, 
and this array should be returned by the function. 

Q3:
It should create a C++ source file named HW2main.cpp. 
In the main function of this file, call functions from previous question.
It should print the π approximation and error for N = 10000 using Q1, and create a vector with elements to
 print out the elements of the array from Q2 using this vector as input.
It should proper use of header files and header guards. 
It should makefile to compile this program into an executable called HW2main.
