Q1：translate the MATLAB code into C++ use switch

Q2：complete the implementation of a C++ function named print_vector 
that takes a reference to a vector of integers (std::vector<int>& v) as a parameter and prints the elements of the vector
uses a range-based for loop to iterate through the elements 

Q3：to generate the Fibonacci sequence using a while loop and return all elements of the sequence that do not exceed the value of 4,000,000.
Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1

Q4：
a：the isprime function checks for special cases where the number is less than 2 (not prime) 
Then, it iterates from 2 to the square root of n to check for divisibility
If n is divisible by any number in this range, it is not a prime number
If no divisor is found, the function returns true, indicating that n is a prime number

b： to complete the implementation of a function named factorize 
that finds all the factors of a given number n and returns them in a vector of integers (std::vector<int>)

c：finds the prime factorization of a given number n and returns the prime factors in a vector of integers (std::vector<int>)
Prime factorization is the process of expressing a number as the product of its prime factors

Q5： write a function that prints the first n rows of Pascal's Triangle. it can use loop.
Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients, where each number is the sum of the two directly above it
